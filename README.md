# Introduction

Illnesses such as stress, poor sleep quality and sleep duration are important aspects that affect an individual's mental and physical health. In the modern era, work demands and fast-paced lifestyles often lead to increased levels of stress, sleep disturbances and various health problems. This is experienced by those who work in high-pressure environments and irregular routines, leading to prolonged sleep disturbances and adverse health effects. Therefore, it is important to explore the relationship between stress levels, sleep quality, and sleep duration with daily activities, such as work, physical activity levels, and living habits.

Research is needed to explore the relationship between stress levels, sleep quality, and sleep duration with daily activities such as work, physical activity levels, and other life habits. A better understanding of how these factors are interrelated is essential for formulating effective and applicable interventions to improve individuals' quality of life, particularly in the context of stress management and physical fitness.

In addition, current machine learning and data science technologies allow us to explore patterns in complex, multivariate data. K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are methods that can assist in grouping individuals based on stress, sleep, and activity patterns, making it easier to create targeted intervention programs for each group.

Using this analytical approach, this study aims to:

1. Identify groups of individuals with different stress and sleep patterns.
2. Analyze the main factors that influence stress levels and sleep quality.
3. Provide recommendations for interventions that can be implemented for each group, based on the analyzed data.
4. Through this research, it is hoped that the results obtained can serve as a foundation for organizations and individuals in creating better health programs, preventing the risk of long-term health problems, and improving quality of life with a data-driven approach.

## Dataset Overview:

The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. It includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.

## Key Features in Dataset

1. Comprehensive Sleep Metrics: Explore sleep duration, quality, and factors influencing sleep patterns
2. Lifestyle Factors: Analyze physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories.
3. Cardiovascular Health: Examine blood pressure and heart rate measurements.
4. Sleep Disorder Analysis: Identify the occurrence of sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea.

## Dataset Columns:

1.  PersonID: An identifier for each individual.
2.  Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).
3.  Age: The age of the person in years.
4.  Occupation: Occupation or profession of person
5.  Sleep Duration (hours): The number of hours the person sleeps per day.
6.  Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.
7.  Physical Activity Level (minutes/day): The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.
8.  Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.
9.  BMI Category: The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
10. Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic): The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.
11. Heart Rate (bpm): The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.
12. Daily Steps: The number of steps the person takes per day.
13. Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

## Details About Sleep Disorder Columns

1.  None: The individual does not exhibit any specific sleep disorder.
2.  Insomnia: The individual experiences difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.
3.  Sleep Apnea: The individual suffers from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.


## Conclusions:
This clustering shows three distinct lifestyle groups based on physical activity and sleep quality. Group 1 (Cluster 0 - marked in yellow) consists of individuals with moderate physical activity and above average sleep quality. Group 2 (Cluster 1 - colored purple) consists of individuals with lower physical activity and sleep quality. Group 3 (Cluster 2 - teal in color) represents a small group with very high physical activity and slightly above average sleep quality.

## Implications:
The results suggest a strong relationship between physical activity levels and sleep quality, with those who are moderately active experiencing better sleep. The outlier group, with the highest activity, also showed improved sleep quality, although not proportionally better than the moderate group. This suggests that there may be a threshold where additional physical activity does not necessarily improve sleep quality.

## Recommendation:
1. Promote a Moderate Physical Activity Program: Given that the moderate group had optimal sleep quality, health initiatives should focus on encouraging regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling or swimming, which can be more sustainable and prevent fatigue.

2. Target for the Low Activity Group: Individuals in the low activity group (Cluster 1) may benefit from programs designed to increase physical activity and sleep, such as guided sleep routines, mindfulness sessions, or short, easy-to-do exercise plans (e.g., walking for 10 minutes daily).

3. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: For the highly active group (Cluster 2), recommendations to combine physical activity with mindfulness practices can help improve overall health, focusing on the balance between activity and relaxation. Stress-reducing interventions such as yoga can further optimize their sleep without adding excessive physical activity.

4. Tailoring the Program Based on Age and Lifestyle: Younger individuals may benefit from more dynamic physical activity (such as sports or team exercises), while older adults may respond better to low-impact exercise paired with sleep hygiene advice.

By implementing these specific, evidence-backed recommendations, you can improve health and lifestyle outcomes by focusing on interventions tailored to the needs of different groups. These measures are not only preventative, but also actionable and measurable in improving physical activity and sleep quality.
